# Welcome Sprinters!

## Complete these 2 steps to get your project going on Day 1!

### Step 1: Create your project Repository.
> A repository contains all project files, including the revision history.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam (right click this URL and open a new page)
2. Click the New button (Green button)
3. From the Create a new repository page fill in the requested information.

> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Repository name: Outbound Funds<br>
> Description: The Outbound Funds project focuses on ...<br>
> Public Repo = true<br>
> Initialize this repository with a README = true<br>
> Add a license = BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <br>
> Click the Create Repository button<br>

### Step 2: Update your Repository README file using our [Project README template](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam/Welcome/wiki/Project-README-template)
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about.

__Be sure the information in your README file is kept up to date for the duration of the Sprint.__

## We've also included resources in the [Wiki](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam/Welcome/wiki) to help you along the way!
