# Welcome Sprinters!

## Complete these 2 steps to get your project going on Day 1!

### Step 1: Create your project Repository.
> A repository contains all project files, including the revision history.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam (right click this URL and open a new page)
2. Click the New button (Green button)
3. From the Create a new repository page fill in the requested information.

> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Repository name: Outbound Funds<br>
> Description: The Outbound Funds project focuses on ...<br>
> Public Repo = true<br>
> Initialize this repository with a README = true<br>
> Add a license = BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <br>
> Click the Create Repository button<br>
***

### Step 2: Update your Repository README file using our [Project README template](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam/Welcome/wiki/Project-README-template)
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about.

__Be sure the information in your README file is kept up to date for the duration of the Sprint.__
***

### Optional Step: Create a Directory folder in your project Repository to house any documentation generated during the Community Day event.
1. From your Project's README.md file click on Create new file
2. Type in the name of the Directory you want to create follwed by a slash (/) follwed by the name of the file that will identify what types of information will be housed here.
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Documentation/Project Documentation
3. In the Edit new file tab add the following message: This directory is where all project documentation will be housed.
4. Add a message in the Commit New File
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Documentation Directory <br>
> Created a Documentation directory for all Project Documentation
5. Ensure Commit directly to the master branch = true
6. Click Commit new file.
