# Welcome Sprinters!

## Complete these 2 steps to get your project going on Day 1!

### Step 1: Create your project Repository.
> A repository contains all project files, including the revision history.

> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Repository name: Outbound Funds<br>
> Description: The Outbound Funds project ...<br>
> Public Repo = true<br>
> Initialize this repository with a README = true<br>
> Add a license = BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <br>
> Click the Create Repository button<br>

### Step 2: Update your Repository README file using our Project README template
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about.

__Be sure the information in your README file is kept up to date for the duration of the Sprint.__
