# Welcome Sprinters!

## Complete these 3 steps to get your project going on Day 1!

### Step 1: Create your project Repository.
> A project repository is your Sprint projects' home. It's a place where all of your project files (documentation, user-stories, code, etc.) will live so that others in the open source community (including Salesforce.org) can have open access to all your work in order to track progress. A repository has the added benefit of allowing future contributors to continue the work started at this Sprint.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam (right click this URL and open a new page)
2. Click the New button (Green button)
3. From the Create a new repository page fill in the requested information.

> __Here is an Example:__<br><br>
> __Repository name:__ Admin Soft Skills<br>
> __Description:__ Salesforce Administrators have the technical skill set to perform the functions of an administrator but many entering the Salesforce.org community lack the soft skills set required to be a successful and impactful administrator. This skills gap within the administrator community is bad for nonprofits, higher ed, partners and the community at large. <br>
> __Public Repo__ = true<br>
> __Initialize this repository with a README__ = true<br>
> __Add .gitignore: None__ (leave this as is)<br>
> __Add a license__ = BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <br>
> Click the Create Repository button<br>
***

### Step 2: Update your Repository README file using our [Project README template](https://github.com/SFDO-Sprint-2019-Amsterdam/Welcome/wiki/Project-README-template)
> A README is the start of your projects documentation on GitHub. Documenting any open source project should always begin with a good README so that potential users can understand what your work is about.

After you copy and paste the template into your Project's README.md file be sure to do the following:

1. Add a message in the Commit changes a the bottom of the README.md file
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Update README.md <br>
> Updated the README.md file using the Project README template.
2. Ensure Commit directly to the master branch = true
3. Click Commit new file.

__Note:__ When editing formatting in your README.md file you will be using Markdown language. You can access the Mastering Markdown Github guide here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

__Be sure the information in your README file is kept up to date for the duration of the Sprint.__
***

### Step 3: Create a Directory folder in your project Repository to house any documentation generated during the Community Day event.
1. From your Project's README.md file click on Create new file
2. Type in the name of the Directory you want to create follwed by a slash (/) follwed by the name of the file that will identify what types of information will be housed here.
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Documentation/Project Documentation
3. In the Edit new file tab add the following message: This directory is where all project documentation will be housed.
4. Add a message in the Commit New File
> __Here is an Example:__<br>
> Documentation Directory <br>
> Created a Documentation directory for all Project Documentation
5. Ensure Commit directly to the master branch = true
6. Click Commit new file.

__Be sure the information in your README file is kept up to date for the duration of the Sprint.__
